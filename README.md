In addition, there are more drivers in urban areas.  The driver counts in urban areas are 2,405 compared to 490 drivers in suburban areas and 78 drivers in rural areas.  Fares collected in urban areas totaled almost $40,000.  Suburban areas collected about half as much in fares and rural areas collected a little over a tenth of fares when compared to urban areas.

           Total Rides  Total Drivers   Total Fares   Average Fare per Ride   Average Fare per Driver

Rural          125              78        $4,327.93        $34.62                $55.49
Suburban       625             490       $19,356.33        $30.97                $39.50
Urban        1,625           2,405       $39,854.38        $24.53                $16.57


Summary

While rural areas received fewer ride request and smaller fares collected, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are substantially more.  This could be a result of fewer drivers and longer trips in rural areas.  Recommendations include more marketing campaigns in rural areas and recruitment of new drivers in rural areas.  An increase in rides from late February to mid March indicates a possible increase in ride share as these areas as weather conditions improve and people are more likely to be active in these areas.  Marketing campaigns would be most effective during these months with a possible increase into April.
